## Roadmap

### Completed Tasks:

1. ~~Init Expo-router project with TypeScript.~~
2. ~~Create a src/ folder structure.~~
3. ~~Add Nativewind.~~
4. ~~Load Google fonts.~~
5. ~~Prettier.~~
6. ~~i18next.~~

### In Progress:
1. Dark/light theme.


### Upcoming Tasks:

1. Add Login Screen/ Register modal.
2. Tutorial screens.
3. Home page with a carousel and two example lists with Shopify flashlist.
4. Settings screen with light/dark toggle switch and language selector.
5. Create an example axios weather call and store it in zustand for creating a universal header component.
6. Create a detail page when clicking on an element on the carousel or list item.
7. Implement onesignal notifications.
8. Create another tab with universal elements.
9. ENV variables handling
10. Re-usable components (Logo, Cards, etc.) 

### Doubts
1. Instead of simple axios calls using react-query. If you have any opinion about this feel free to open a discussion.
2. Create a universal library for handling expo-icons. -> Create a universal component which can handle all the icon libs within one component.
3. E-commerce components/pages
4. Subscription implementation with [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/)
